# Postcodes
There is no open reliable source for postcodes - Codici di Avviamento
Postale (CAP).

Postcodes are assignd to comunes and sometiimse to the entities inside them. In
most cased a comune has one postcode assigned to it. In the 2016 some comunes have
beed suppreseed and some were created. We need actual postcodes.

I found one web site with postcodes, but it has outdates structure for
the provinces of Sardegna.

Another site has no compleate list of comunes.
